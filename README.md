 Random Color Generator

A simple JavaScript project that changes the background to a random color when you click a button.  
It also displays the HEX code of the generated color so you can use it anywhere.

 How It Works
1. When the button is clicked, the script starts with `#`.
2. It loops 6 times, each time picking a random character from `0–9` or `A–F`.
3. These characters form a hex color code like `#F4B9E2`.
4. The background changes to the new color and the hex code is shown on screen.
